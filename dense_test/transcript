# ** Note: (vsim-3813) Design is being optimized due to module recompilation...
# ** Warning: (vopt-10587) Some optimizations are turned off because the +acc switch is in effect. This will cause your simulation to run slowly. Please use -access/-debug to maintain needed visibility. The +acc switch would be deprecated in a future release.
# Support of the MGLS_LICENSE_FILE and LM_LICENSE_FILE licensing environment variables will be discontinued starting with the 2025.1 release. Please update to using the SALT_LICENSE_SERVER variable.
